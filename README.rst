pydsol-flow - Flow-based Discrete-Event Simulation
==================================================

pydsol-flow is a discrete simulation library, based on the flow package of
the Java DSOL library. The 'process flow' modeling formalism consists of
Entities that flow between blocks where they undergo state transformations
such as change of attributes, delays, batching, splitting, etc. Queue-Resource 
behavior is typically implemented in many blocks, such as the Server. Many 
commercial general purpose discrete-event simulation package implement 
the flow formalism as well.
